# CLI for Launch

## CLI for Launch

[Launch](/docs/launch/about-launch/) is a deployment platform that enables you to host your Contentstack-powered JAM stack website instantly. Launch hosts websites managed by any CMS (headless or traditional).

You can create a project in Launch by [connecting your GitHub repository](/docs/launch/import-project-using-github/)—Launch deploys your site instantly. Alternatively, you can [upload a folder or .zip file](/docs/launch/import-project-using-file-upload/) to create a project.

This step-by-step guide discusses how you can perform different operations in Launch using the CLI.

## What You Will Learn

-   How to create a Launch project from GitHub or a file upload using the CLI.
    
-   How to redeploy an existing Launch project, including from a CI environment.
    
-   How to fetch logs, list deployments and environments, test cloud functions, and open the live site.
    
-   How to roll back to a previous deployment.
    

## Prerequisites

-   [Contentstack account](https://www.contentstack.com/login/)
-   [CLI installed](/docs/headless-cms/install-the-cli/) and [configured](/docs/headless-cms/configure-regions-in-the-cli/) for AWS (version 1.6.0 and above), Azure (version 1.23.0 and above), or GCP (version 1.31.0 and above)
    
    **Note:** Starting with **CLI version 2.0.0-beta.30**, the Launch plugin is **no longer bundled with the Contentstack CLI**. Versions prior to 2.0.0-beta.30 continue to bundle and install it automatically. From version 2.0.0-beta.30 onward, install the plugin separately before running launch commands:
    
    ```
    $ csdx plugins:install @contentstack/cli-launch $ csdx launch
    ```
    
-   [CLI authenticated](/docs/headless-cms/cli-authentication/) (the cli-launch plugin supports only login-based authentication)
-   Launch-enabled Organization with [permissions](/docs/administration/about-administration-roles)
-   [GitHub account](https://github.com/login) where your website code is hosted
    
    **Note:** This prerequisite is applicable only if you are importing a project via GitHub.
    

## Commands

Contentstack Launch lets you perform the following operations in Contentstack CLI:

-   [Launch (Create a Project)](#launch-create-a-project)
-   [Logs](#logs)
-   [Functions](#functions)
-   [Deployments](#deployments)
-   [Environments](#environments)
-   [Open](#open)

### Launch (Create a Project)

To begin with, create a project in Launch using the CLI by importing a project from [GitHub](/docs/launch/import-project-using-github) or [uploading a file](/docs/launch/import-project-using-file-upload/). To do this, follow the steps given below:

1.  Open the terminal and fire the launch command:
    
    -   Run the below command if you are in the current working directory.
        
        ```
        csdx launch
        ```
        
    -   If you are in a different directory, provide the path of the current working directory.
        
        ```
        csdx launch --data-dir <path>
        ```
        
        **Note:** If you choose GitHub to create your project, provide the directory path in the Git repository as the current working directory path.
        
    
    **Note:** Launch automatically identifies Git projects.
    
2.  If your current working directory is not a Git repository, you will be prompted to choose a project type to proceed. Select **Continue with GitHub** or **Continue with FileUpload** to proceed.  
    ![Launch_Plugin-Project_Type.png](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt2d43f51baca745a8/blt0e0d2bc64da6923d/6437b49d1c46cc118806d761/Launch_Plugin-Project_Type.png)
3.  Select the **organization** where you want to create your project.
4.  In this step, select a **branch** if you decided to create your project using GitHub.
5.  Enter a **name** for your project.
6.  Enter a **name** for your Environment or press **Enter** to proceed with the Default environment.
7.  By default, Launch identifies the framework. Select a **Framework Preset** if you want to change the default framework, and then press **Enter**.
8.  In the Build Command section, perform one of the following:
    -   Press **Enter** if you want to proceed with the default Build command npm run build.
    -   Or, enter a new build command or update the existing command if you want to customize the command.
9.  Enter the output path in the **Output Directory** section or press **Enter** to proceed with the default output path.
10.  Enter the server command in the **Server Command** section or press **Enter** to proceed.
11.  Select a response mode:
     
     -   **Streaming**: Delivers response chunks in real time as they are generated.
     -   **Buffered**: Displays output only after the entire response has been generated.
     
     **Note:** Buffered is selected by default.
     
12.  **Enable Contentstack Authentication**: Restricts access to this environment to members of your Contentstack organization. Enter **Y** to enable it or **n** to disable it. If you press **Enter** without entering a value, it is enabled by default.
13.  In the next step, follow the instructions provided on screen to choose one or more of the following options to import or add the variables:
     -   **Import variables from a stack**
         
         Use this option to import environment variables directly from an existing stack in your organization.  
         If selected, you’ll be prompted to choose a specific **Stack** and provide a valid **Delivery Token**.
         
     -   **Manually add custom variables to the list**
         
         You can manually add variables as key-value pairs.  
         If selected, after adding key-value pairs, a prompt, Would you like to add more variables.? appears.
         
         -   Enter **Y** to add another custom variable.
         -   Enter **n** to proceed with the project deployment.
         
     -   **Import variables from the** **.env.local** **file**
         
         You can import variables from a .env.local file.
         
         **Note:** Create a .env.local file in the repo to import variables from your .env.local file. In this file, each key-value pair must be on a separate line using the format KEY=VALUE.
         
     -   **Skip adding environment variables**
         
         Allows you to skip these options and create a project without any environment variables.
         
         **Note:** The 'Skip adding environment variables' option cannot be combined with other environment variable options. You can either choose 'Skip adding environment variables' or one or more of the other available options.

     --config=/root/configs/project1/dev.json
    ```
    

### Using Launch CLI in a CI Environment

The Launch CLI can be utilized within CI environments to trigger redeployments for Launch projects. Follow the steps below to configure and use Launch CLI in your CI pipeline.

#### Prerequisites

-   **Environment Setup**
    -   Use the Launch UI to create the necessary environments for your Launch project. This is a one-time setup process.
    -   For detailed steps, refer to the [Creating a New Environment](/docs/launch/environments#create-an-environment) guide.
-   **Configuration in Codebase**
    
    -   In the root directory of your project, create a configuration file named cs-launch.json.
    -   Use the following structure as a template:
    
    ```
    {
      "project": {
        "uid": "<projectUid>",
        "name": "<projectName>",
        "projectType": "GITHUB", // (Or FILEUPLOAD if it's a FILEUPLOAD-based project)
        "organizationUid": "<organizationUid>",
        "environments": [
          {
            "uid": "<environmentUid>",
            "name": "<environmentName>",
            "frameworkPreset": "OTHER" // Possible values: GATSBY, NEXTJS, CRA, CSR, ANGULAR, VUEJS, OTHER
          }
        ],
        "deployments": [
          {
            "uid": "<deploymentUid of latest or any previous deployment belonging to the particular environment>"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
    
    You can find the values for projectUid, environmentUid, organizationUid, and deploymentUid by inspecting the network requests made to your deployed site. These values are available in the response headers:
    
    -   x-project-uid
    -   x-environment-uid
    -   x-org-uid
    -   x-deployment-uid
    
    **Commit** the cs-launch.json file to your repository.
    

#### Triggering Redeployments in CI

Use the following steps to trigger a redeployment using the Launch CLI within your CI environment:

-   [**Set Region**](/docs/headless-cms/configure-regions-in-the-cli#set-region)
    
    Configure the CLI to use the appropriate region.
    
    **Example:** csdx config:set:region NA
    
-   [**Authenticate**](/docs/headless-cms/cli-authentication#login) **with Launch CLI**
    
    Use the csdx auth:login command to log in.
    
    **Example:** csdx auth:login --username youremail@contentstack.com --password **\***
    
-   **Trigger Redeployment**
    
    Use the following command to redeploy a specific environment:
    
    **Example:** csdx launch -c /path/to/project/launch-cli-config/cs-launch.json -e development --redeploy-latest
    

**Note:** The Launch CLI exits with a **non-zero status code** if the deployment fails. Ensure your CI pipeline is configured to handle this appropriately.

By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate Launch redeployments into your CI/CD pipeline, enhancing automation and deployment efficiency.

### Logs

You can fetch the previous [deployment logs](/docs/launch/deployments#deployment-logs) and the latest server logs for Launch projects in CLI using the launch:logs command.

1.  Open a terminal and fire the launch:logs command:
    
    ```
    csdx launch:logs
    ```
    
2.  Select the **organization** where you created the project.
3.  Then, select your **project** for which you want to fetch the logs.
4.  Select the required **environment**.

### Rollback

You can roll back to a previous successful deployment for a Launch project using the launch:rollback command in the CLI. This performs an [instant rollback](/docs/launch/instant-rollbacks), restoring your application to a previously archived deployment without triggering a rebuild.

1.  Open a terminal and run the launch:rollback command:
    
    ```
    csdx launch:rollback
    ```
    
2.  Select the **organization** where you created the project.
3.  Select your **project**.
4.  Select the **environment** you want to roll back.
5.  Select an eligible **deployment** to restore from the list of previously successful deployments. The CLI displays the eligible archived deployments with their deployment number, branch, commit hash, commit message, and timestamp.
6.  Review the rollback summary. The CLI displays:
    -   **Current Live** deployment number
    -   **Roll back to** deployment number, branch, commit hash, and timestamp
7.  Enter a **Reason** for the rollback (saved to the audit log), or press **Enter** to skip.
8.  When prompted with **Confirm & Rollback?**, enter **Y** to proceed or **n** to cancel.

You have successfully rolled back to a previous deployment. The CLI confirms the rollback with the new deployment ID and status.

**Note:**

-   The rolled back instance uses the environment variables associated with the selected deployment.
-   Auto-deployments triggered by commits, webhooks, or automations may continue to run during a rollback. Disable them before you begin to avoid unintended deployments.

**Usage**

```
csdx launch:rollback
```

**Options**

-   \-e, --environment=environment: \[optional\] Environment number or UID.
-   \--deployment=deployment: \[optional\] Deployment UID to roll back to.
-   \--org=org: \[optional\] Provide the organization UID.
-   \--project=project: \[optional\] Provide the project UID.
-   \--reason=reason: \[optional\] Reason for the rollback (saved to audit log).

**Examples**

To perform an interactive rollback by selecting options from prompts:

```
csdx launch:rollback
```

To roll back a specific environment to a specific deployment:

```
csdx launch:rollback -e "environment number or UID" --deployment=<deployment UID>
```

To roll back by providing the organization, project, and reason:

```
csdx launch:rollback -e "environment number or UID" \
  --deployment=<deployment UID> \
  --org=<org UID> \
  --project=<Project UID> \
  --reason="restoring previous build"
```

## Limitations

-   Creating a new Launch environment via the CLI is currently not supported. At this time, environment creation is a one-time setup that must be done through the Launch UI. Once the environment is created, the Launch CLI can be used to trigger [redeployments on existing environments](#launch-redeploy-an-existing-project).
-   Currently, the Launch CLI does not support Bitbucket Cloud as a source provider.
-   Currently, the Launch CLI does not support modifying settings for existing projects or environments. To make these changes, please use the Launch UI.
