# Bulk Publish and Unpublish Content | Old Commands

## Bulk Publish and Unpublish Content

The Bulk Publish and Unpublish commands allow you to publish entries and assets from multiple content types to one or more environments.

## Prerequisites

-   [Contentstack account](https://www.contentstack.com/login)
-   CLI [installed](/docs/headless-cms/install-the-cli) on your machine
-   [Authentication](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/headless-cms/cli-authentication/) to use CLI
-   A [configured management token](/docs/headless-cms/cli-authentication#add-token) 

## Commands

To perform bulk publish and unpublish operations on entries and assets, there are a series of commands that you need to run in the CLI.

Let's discuss them in detail.

### Bulk Publish All Entries

The **cm:bulk-publish:entries** command lets you publish multiple entries on multiple environments for specific locales.

**Usage**

```
csdx cm:bulk-publish:entries -t <content_type_uid> -l <locale_code> -e <environment_name>
```

**Note:** To avoid bulk publish failure, we recommend you to bulk publish content of one content type at a time.

**Options**

-   \-t, --contentTypes=contentTypes: The UID of the content type(s) whose entries you want to publish in bulk. In case of multiple content types, specify the IDs separated by spaces.
-   \-l, \--locales=locales: Locales in which entries will be published, e.g., _en-us_. In the case of multiple locales, specify the codes separated by spaces.
-   \-e, \--environments=environments: The name of the environment on which entries will be published. In case of multiple environments, specify their names separated by spaces.
-   \-a, \--alias=alias: Alias (name) of the management token.
-   \-B, \--branch=branch: The name of the branch where you want to perform the bulk publish operation. If you don’t mention the branch name, then by default the content from the **main** branch will be published.
-   \-o, \--publishAllContentTypes: _(optional)_ Set it to **true** to bulk publish entries from all content types. If the **contentTypes** option is already used, then you cannot use this option.
-   \-b, \--\[no-\]bulkPublish=bulkPublish: Set this flag to use Contentstack’s Bulk Publish APIs. It is **true,** by default.
-   \-r, \--retryFailed=retryFailed: _(optional)_ Use this option to retry publishing the failed entries/assets from the logfile. Specify the name of the logfile that lists failed publish calls. If this option is used, it will override all other flags.
-   \-y, \--yes: Set it to **true** to process the command with the current configuration.
-   \-c, \--config=config: _(optional)_ The path of the optional configuration JSON file containing all the options for a single run. Refer to the [**configure**](#build-the-configuration-file) command to create a configuration file.

### Bulk Publish Edited Entries

### Build the Configuration File

The **cm:bulk-publish:configure** command lets you generate a template for the configuration JSON file. It will set the variables for the Bulk Publish commands.

After you generate the configuration file, you can simply use its path in the \-c, \--config=config option of any Bulk Publish commands. You can view this [reference configuration file](https://github.com/contentstack/cli/blob/main/packages/contentstack-bulk-publish/src/config/index.js) for Bulk Publish commands.

**Usage**

```
csdx cm:bulk-publish:configure
```

**Additional Resource:** If you want to migrate your content from one stack to another, refer to the [Migration](/docs/headless-cms/migrate-your-content-using-the-cli-migration-command) guide.

## Limitations

-   The [cm:bulk-publish:add-fields](#bulk-publish-all-entries-after-adding-a-new-field-in-the-content-type) command does not work for [custom](/docs/headless-cms/custom) and [mandatory](/docs/headless-cms/mandatory) fields.
