# Bulk Publish and Unpublish Content

## Bulk Publish and Unpublish Content

The Bulk publish and unpublish commands allow you to publish entries and assets from multiple content types to one or more environments, and unpublish entries and assets.

## Prerequisites

-   [Contentstack account](https://www.contentstack.com/login)
-   CLI [installed](/docs/headless-cms/install-the-cli) and [configured](/docs/headless-cms/configure-regions-in-the-cli/) (version 1.7.0 and above)
-   [Authentication](/docs/headless-cms/cli-authentication) to use CLI
-   A [configured management token](/docs/headless-cms/cli-authentication#add-management-token) 

## Commands

To perform bulk publish and unpublish operations on entries and assets, there are a series of commands that you need to run in the CLI. 

Let's discuss them in detail.

**Additional Resource:** Contentstack CLI lets you configure rate limits for various bulk publishing operations. Read more about [using rate limits for enhanced bulk publishing control](/docs/headless-cms/configure-rate-limits-in-the-cli#using-rate-limits-for-enhanced-bulk-publishing-control).

### Bulk Publish All Entries

The cm:entries:publish command lets you publish multiple entries on multiple environments for specific locales.

**Usage:**

```
csdx cm:entries:publish --content-types <content_type_uid> --locales <locale_code> -e <environment_name> --stack-api-key <source_stack_api_key>
```

**Note:** To avoid bulk publish failure, we recommend you to bulk publish content of one content type at a time.

**Options:**

-   \--content-types=content-types: The UID of the content type(s) whose entries you want to publish in bulk. In case of multiple content types, specify the IDs separated by spaces.
-   \--locales=locales: Locales in which entries will be published, e.g., _en-us_. In the case of multiple locales, specify the codes separated by spaces.
-   \-e, \--environments=environments: The name of the environment on which entries will be published. In case of multiple environments, specify their names separated by spaces.
-   \-a, \--alias=alias: Alias (name) of the management token. You must use either the \--alias flag or the \--stack-api-key flag.

### Build the Configuration File

The cm:stacks:publish-configure command lets you generate a template for the configuration JSON file. It will set the variables for the Bulk Publish commands.

After you generate the configuration file, you can simply use its path in the -c , \--config=config option of any Bulk Publish commands. You can view this [reference configuration file](https://github.com/contentstack/cli/blob/v2.0.0-beta/packages/contentstack-bulk-publish/src/config/index.js) for Bulk Publish commands.

**Usage:**

```
csdx cm:stacks:publish-configure --stack-api-key <stack_api_key>

## Troubleshooting

### Assets remain unpublished after cm:assets:publish --backup-dir

**Root Cause(s)**: Asset scanning found the asset still in the scan queue at the time the command ran. The retry mechanism for in-queue assets is disabled in this release, so the asset is skipped immediately instead of being retried.

**Resolution**: Wait for the asset's scan to complete, then run cm:assets:publish --backup-dir <BACKUP\_DIR> again. Assets are not retried automatically within a single command run.

### csdx cm:assets:publish --data-dir ... reports an unrecognized flag

**Root Cause(s)**: A message printed at the end of asset import (from cm:stacks:import) tells you to run csdx cm:assets:publish --data-dir <BACKUP\_DIR> ... to publish assets after scanning. cm:assets:publish does not have a \--data-dir flag.

**Resolution**: Use \--backup-dir instead: csdx cm:assets:publish --backup-dir <BACKUP\_DIR> --stack-api-key <STACK\_API\_KEY>.

### Import prints an asset-scanning message but the org does not have asset scanning enabled

**Root Cause(s)**: The reminder to run cm:assets:publish --backup-dir after import is printed whenever assets were imported and skipAssetsPublish is set, including when \--skip-assets-publish was passed manually and asset scanning played no part. The message text does not distinguish the two cases.

**Resolution**: Check whether \--skip-assets-publish was passed explicitly. If it was, the message is unrelated to asset scanning and assets can be published normally with csdx cm:assets:publish --backup-dir <BACKUP\_DIR> --stack-api-key <STACK\_API\_KEY> at any time.

## Limitations

-   The [cm:bulk-publish:add-fields](#bulk-publish-all-entries-after-adding-a-new-field-in-the-content-type) command does not work for [custom](/docs/headless-cms/custom) and [mandatory](/docs/headless-cms/mandatory) fields.
-   To manage API request timing and prevent concurrency issues, add the delayMs parameter to your configuration file to add controlled delays between requests. For example, use delayMs: 1000 (for 1-second delays).
-   On stacks with asset scanning enabled, cm:assets:publish does not retry assets that are still in the scan queue. See [Assets remain unpublished after cm:assets:publish --backup-dir](#assets-remain-unpublished-after-cmassetspublish---backup-dir) for the resolution.
