# Migrate Content Between Stacks Using the CLI | V2.x.x

## Migrate Content Between Stacks Using the CLI

This document guides you through the process of migrating content from one Contentstack stack to another manually.

**Warning:** The export writes content flat into the folder you name. It does not create a <branch-uid>/ subfolder, even when you pass \--branch. Use the same path for the export and the import, and use a separate \--data-dir per branch, because exporting a second branch into the same folder overwrites the first with no error.

If you are importing an export produced by CLI V1, that layout did nest content under a branch subfolder. Point \--data-dir at the subfolder itself, for example ./export/main, because the automatic branch detection that V1 relied on has been removed.

## Prerequisites

-   [Contentstack account](https://www.contentstack.com/login/)
-   Contentstack CLI [installed](/docs/headless-cms/install-the-cli) and [configured](/docs/headless-cms/configure-regions-in-the-cli)
-   CLI [authenticated](/docs/headless-cms/cli-authentication#authentication)
-   Access to both source and target stacks
-   An empty target stack

## Steps for Execution

To migrate all content from one stack to another quickly, follow the steps below:

-   [Export](/docs/headless-cms/export-content-using-the-cli) from source stack:
    
    ```
    csdx cm:stacks:export -k <source_stack_api_key> --data-dir ./export --branch main
    ```
    
-   [Audit](/docs/headless-cms/cli-audit-plugin) the exported content (recommended):
    
    ```
    csdx cm:stacks:audit --data-dir ./export
    ```
    
    **Note:** The [audit](/docs/headless-cms/cli-audit-plugin) process runs automatically during [import](/docs/headless-cms/import-content-using-the-cli) to validate and fix any issues.
    
-   [Import](/docs/headless-cms/import-content-using-the-cli) to target stack:
    
    ```
    csdx cm:stacks:import -k <target_stack_api_key> --data-dir ./export
    ```
    

## Behaviour to Check Before You Rely on the Result

-   **Only the main branch is exported by default.** If you omit \--branch, the export covers the branch named main and nothing else, and it fails when no such branch exists. Pass \--branch once per branch to move a multi-branch stack.
-   **Global fields from a V1 export are skipped silently.** If the folder you import came from CLI V1, every global field is skipped with no error and no warning, because V1 wrote them to a single aggregate file and the current importer reads one file per UID. The step reports success having created nothing. Re-export the source stack with the current CLI before importing.
