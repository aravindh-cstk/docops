# Apps CLI Plugin | V2.x.x

## Apps CLI Plugin

Contentstack lets you develop apps in your organization using the [Developer Hub](/docs/developer-hub/about-developer-hub/) portal. With the Apps CLI plugin, Contentstack CLI allows you to perform the CRUD operations on your app in Developer Hub and then use the app in your organization or stack by installing or uninstalling your app as required.  

This step-by-step guide lets you install and use the Apps CLI plugin in CLI.

## Prerequisites

-   [Contentstack account](https://www.contentstack.com/login/)
-   [CLI installed](/docs/headless-cms/install-the-cli) and [configured](/docs/headless-cms/configure-regions-in-the-cli) (version 2.0.0 and above)
-   [CLI authenticated](/docs/headless-cms/cli-authentication)

**Note:** This plugin requires Node.js 22 or later, and it authenticates with your login session rather than a management token. Run csdx auth:login before using any app: command.

## Install the Apps CLI Plugin

Install the Apps CLI plugin using the following command:

```
csdx plugins:install @contentstack/apps-cli
```

## Commands

The Apps CLI Plugin lets you perform the following operations in Contentstack CLI:

-   [Create an App](#create-an-app)
-   [Get App Details](#get-app-details)
-   [Install an App](#install-an-app)
-   [Update an App](#update-an-app)

### Create an App

The app:create command allows you to create or register an app in Developer Hub, and optionally, clone a boilerplate locally. Let's perform the following steps to create an app:

1.  Open a terminal.
2.  Fire the following command:
    
    ```
    csdx app:create
    ```
    
3.  In the prompt that appears, select a **boilerplate template**.
4.  Enter a **name** for your app.
5.  Select an **organization**.
6.  In the prompt that appears, select **Y** if you want to fetch the app template from GitHub. Else select **n**.
