# CLI-Supported Features for Export, Import, and Clone Operations | V2.x.x

## CLI-Supported Features for Export, Import, and Clone Operations

---

## Overview

Contentstack CLI offers support for [export](/docs/headless-cms/export-content-using-the-cli), [import](/docs/headless-cms/import-content-using-the-cli), and clone operations, including Marketplace apps, module-wise imports, error handling, and Personalize project integration.

This guide outlines these features to help you manage content migration operations with flexibility and control.

---

## Supported Modules

The CLI supports the following modules for export, import, and clone operations:

| Module | Export | Import | Clone | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Content Types** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Schema definitions |
| **Entries** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Content entries |
| **Assets** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Media files |
| **Environments** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Environment configurations |
| **Extensions** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Experience extensions |
| **Global Fields** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Global field definitions |
| **Labels** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Content labels |
| **Locales** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Locale configurations |
| **Webhooks** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Webhook configurations |
| **Workflows** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Workflow definitions |
| **Custom Roles** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Custom role definitions |
| **Taxonomies** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Taxonomy structures |
| **Marketplace Apps** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Public and private apps |
| **Personalize** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Personalize projects |
| **Entry Variants** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Entry variant configurations |
| **CS Assets** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Space-based assets (requires cs-assets region config) |
| **Publishing Rules** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Workflow publishing rules |
| **Composable Studio** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Requires Basic Auth. Skipped when you authenticate with a management token or with OAuth |

The names in the table above are display names. When you pass \--module on the export or import command, use the identifier form instead: stack, assets, locales, environments, extensions, webhooks, global-fields, entries, content-types, custom-roles, workflows, publishing-rules, labels, marketplace-apps, taxonomies, personalize, variant-entries, composable-studio. The identifier variant-entries is valid on import only. The CLI validates the value before the operation starts and fails immediately on an unknown name.

---

## Marketplace Apps

You can export/import public and private Marketplace apps into a stack using CLI commands.

### Prerequisites

-   **Logged In:** CLI authenticated (see [CLI Authentication and Adding Tokens](/docs/headless-cms/cli-authentication))
-   **Permissions:** Owner or Admin rights to export Marketplace apps
-   **Marketplace Apps Support:** Enabled in the destination organization

**Important Notes:**

-   Only the latest version of a public or private Marketplace app can be installed via CLI
-   If you're using a region other than AWS NA, AWS EU, AWS AU, Azure NA, Azure EU, GCP NA, or GCP EU, provide the Developer Hub URL when prompted
-   To override the default Marketplace app encryption key, update the config.json file

### Public Apps

If a public Marketplace app with a specific configuration already exists in the destination organization, you will be prompted with the following options during import:

-   **Update** - Update the app with the new configuration from the source organization

-   **Skip updating** - Skip updating the app configuration

    **Warning:** Skipping may result in issues with imported content.

-   **Exit** - Cancel the entire stack import process


**Example:**

```
# Export with Marketplace apps
csdx cm:stacks:export -a source-alias --data-dir ./export

# Import with Marketplace apps (interactive prompts)
csdx cm:stacks:import -a target-alias --data-dir ./export
```

### Private Apps

If the imported app has the same name as an existing app in the destination stack:

-   You will be prompted to **rename** the imported app

**Note:** App names must be **3-20 characters** long.

**During Stack Import:**

-   If acknowledged and confirmed, the listed private app(s) will be re-created and installed
-   If you cancel the app recreation, it may disrupt the import process of entries, content types, or global fields
-   To skip re-creation of private apps if they already exist, use the flag

**Skip App Recreation:**

```
csdx cm:stacks:import \
  -a target-alias \
  --data-dir ./export \
  -y
```

**Important:** You cannot reuse any existing private apps during the import process.

### Error Handling

If an error occurs while importing a public or private app:

-   You will be prompted to confirm whether to proceed
    -   If you choose **not to proceed**, the import stops
    -   If you choose **to proceed**, the import may still succeed but could affect entries, content types, or global fields

## Personalize and Entry Variants

When working with stacks that are synced with a [Personalize](/docs/personalize/about-personalize) project, certain modules and configurations are automatically handled during export and import operations.

### Exporting

If the stack you're exporting is linked to a Personalize project, the following items will be exported:

-   **Personalize Project** - The associated Personalize project
-   **Personalize Modules:**
    -   [Experiences](/docs/personalize/about-experiences/)
    -   [Audience](/docs/personalize/about-audiences/)
    -   [Attributes](/docs/personalize/about-attributes/)
    -   [Events](/docs/personalize/about-events/)
-   **Entry Variants** - Exported from the stack as part of entries

**Example:**

```
# Export stack with Personalize project
csdx cm:stacks:export -a source-alias --data-dir ./export
```

### Importing

If the content you're importing is associated or synced with a Personalize project, a new Personalize project will be created and linked to the new stack. Additionally, the following items will be imported:

-   **Personalize Modules:**
    -   Experiences
    -   Audience
    -   Attributes
    -   Events
-   **Entry Variants** - Imported into the stack as part of entries

**Options:**

| Option | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| --personalize-project-name | Provide a unique name for the Personalize project | No |

**Example:**

```
# Import with Personalize project
csdx cm:stacks:import \
  -a target-alias \
  --data-dir ./export \
  --personalize-project-name "My Personalize Project"
```

**Note:** Variants and Personalize currently support only basic authentication.

### Personalize and Entry Variants Limitation

**Important:** The \-a <alias> flag (management token) skips Personalize modules as they require an [auth token for import](/docs/headless-cms/import-content-using-the-cli#import-content-using-management-token) and cannot be imported using a management token.

**Workaround:**

-   Use csdx auth:login for authentication instead of management tokens when importing Personalize projects
-   Or use \--stack-api-key with login-based authentication

---

## CS Assets

The CLI uses CS Assets for asset export and import only when **both** of the following conditions are met:

-   A CS Assets URL is configured for your region using csdx config:set:region.
-   The stack branch has linked workspaces in your Contentstack organization.

**Note:** Linked workspaces are CS Assets spaces in your Contentstack organization that are associated with a branch. The CLI reads them automatically from branch settings.

### Partial activation behavior

When only one condition is met, the CLI behaves as follows:

| Condition | Export behavior | Import behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CS Assets URL configured, no linked workspaces | Falls back to legacy asset export silently | Falls back to legacy asset export silently |
| Linked workspaces found, no CS Assets URL | Falls back to legacy asset export silently | Logs a message and skips the CS Assets step. Import continues for all other modules (content types, entries, locales). |

### Exporting

When both conditions are met, the CLI activates CS Assets mode automatically and writes assets under a spaces/ directory instead of assets/.

```
csdx cm:stacks:export -k <stack-api-key> --data-dir ./export
```

**Note:** Use csdx auth:login for CS Assets export. When using a management token, the CLI cannot read branch settings, so linked workspaces are never populated and CS Assets mode never activates. The export falls back to legacy asset export. See [Management Token Behavior](/docs/headless-cms/cli-for-cs-assets#management-token-behavior).

### How CS Assets differs from legacy asset export

| Aspect | Legacy Asset Export | CS Assets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Export directory** | assets/ at branch root | spaces/ at branch root |
| **Asset organization** | Single flat structure | Per-space directories (spaces/{space\_uid}/) |
| **Fields & asset types** | Not exported | Exported once per run; org-level definitions shared across all spaces (spaces/fields/, spaces/asset\_types/) |
| **Space metadata** | N/A | Exported to spaces/{space\_uid}/space.json |
| **Activation** | Always on | Automatic when CS Assets URL is configured and linked workspaces exist |
| **Management token** | Supported | Falls back to legacy asset export. The CLI skips the stack-settings step and logs a debug message. |

### Importing

CS Assets import works with all authentication methods, including management tokens.

```
csdx cm:stacks:import -k <stack-api-key> --data-dir ./export
```

The import command detects CS Assets mode when **both** the spaces/ directory and the am\_v2 key in stack/settings.json are present in the export directory. No additional flags are required. See [How CS Assets import is detected](/docs/headless-cms/cli-for-cs-assets#how-cs-assets-import-is-detected).

For full details on CS Assets export and import behavior, see [CLI for CS Assets](/docs/headless-cms/cli-for-cs-assets).

## Module-Wise Operations

You can export, import, or clone specific modules instead of all modules.

### Export Specific Modules

```
# Export only entries
csdx cm:stacks:export -a <alias> --data-dir ./export --module entries

# Export multiple modules
csdx cm:stacks:export -a <alias> --data-dir ./export --module entries assets content-types
```

### Import Specific Modules

```
# Import only entries
csdx cm:stacks:import -a <alias> --data-dir ./export --module entries

# Import multiple modules
csdx cm:stacks:import -a <alias> --data-dir ./export --module entries assets content-types
```

### Clone Specific Modules

```
# Clone structure only (no entries/assets)
csdx cm:stacks:clone \
  --source-management-token-alias source-alias \
  --destination-management-token-alias destination-alias \
  --type a

# Clone structure with content (all modules)
csdx cm:stacks:clone \
  --source-management-token-alias source-alias \
  --destination-management-token-alias destination-alias \
  --type b
```

## Error Handling

The CLI provides comprehensive error handling for export, import, and clone operations:

### Export Errors

-   **Authentication Errors:** Verify management token or login credentials
-   **Permission Errors:** Ensure you have appropriate permissions
-   **Network Errors:** Check network connectivity and region configuration
-   **Module Errors:** Verify module names are correct

### Import Errors

-   **Module Already Exists:** Use \--replace-existing flag or import-setup command
-   **Dependency Errors:** Import dependencies before dependent modules
-   **Reference Errors:** Run audit fix before import
-   **Marketplace App Errors:** Handle app recreation prompts or use

### Clone Errors

-   **Permission Errors:** Ensure owner/admin rights for creating stacks
-   **Authentication Errors:** Verify management token aliases
-   **Marketplace App Errors:** Provide encryption key (3 attempts allowed)

For detailed troubleshooting, see the CLI Troubleshooting Guide.

## Best Practices

### Marketplace Apps

-   **Test First:** Test Marketplace app import on staging before production
-   **Backup:** Always backup before importing Marketplace apps
-   **Review Configuration:** Review app configurations before updating
-   **Skip Recreation:** Use if apps already exist and are configured correctly

### Personalize Projects

-   **Use Login Authentication:** Use csdx auth:login instead of management tokens for Personalize imports
-   **Unique Project Names:** Provide unique names for Personalize projects
-   **Verify Sync:** Verify Personalize project sync after import

### Module-Wise Operations

-   **Import Dependencies First:** Import dependencies before dependent modules
-   **Use Import-Setup:** Use import-setup for selective module updates
-   **Test Incrementally:** Test module imports incrementally

For more best practices, see the CLI Best Practices Guide.

## Limitations

For detailed limitations, see the [CLI Limitations Guide](/docs/headless-cms/cli-limitations).

**Key Limitations:**

-   Only latest version of Marketplace apps can be installed
-   Personalize modules require login authentication (not management tokens)
-   Entry variants are exported/imported as part of entries
-   Some modules may have dependencies that must be imported first
