# Uninstall CLI Plugins

## Uninstall CLI Plugins

If you have created or installed a plugin using [Contentstack CLI](/docs/headless-cms/install-the-cli), and want to uninstall/ remove that plugin, you can do it by using the **plugins:uninstall** command.

**Note:** This command will not delete the plugin’s code folder.

To do this, run the following commands in your terminal:  

1.  Get a list of plugins you have installed:  
    
    ```
    csdx plugins
    ```
    
2.  From the available plugins listed in the terminal, uninstall it by passing its name in the command below:  
    
    ```
    csdx plugins:uninstall <<plugin_name>>
    ```
