# Configure Early Access in the CLI

## Configure Early Access in the CLI

Contentstack’s **Early Access** program provides customers with the opportunity to explore Contentstack's products and features before they are generally available. Through this program, users can engage in collaborative communication with the product teams, enabling them to test and influence the development of products tailored to their organization's unique requirements.

The configuration of headers in a Command Line Interface (CLI) involves the setting of HTTP headers when interacting with web services or APIs through the command line. The Early Access header support in CLI includes commands to set, get and remove headers for requests made to web servers or APIs for Contentstack products and features before they are generally available.

This step-by-step guide lets you configure and use the Early Access header in the CLI.

## Prerequisites

-   [Contentstack account](https://www.contentstack.com/login/)
-   [CLI installed](/docs/headless-cms/install-the-cli/) and [configured](/docs/headless-cms/configure-regions-in-the-cli/) (version 1.12.1 and above)
-   [CLI authenticated](/docs/headless-cms/cli-authentication/)

## Commands

1.  Open the terminal.
2.  Fire the following command:

The config:get:early-access-header command fetches a list of the Early Access headers that you have set in the CLI.
