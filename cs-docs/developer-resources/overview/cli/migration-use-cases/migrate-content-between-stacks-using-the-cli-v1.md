# Migrate Content Between Stacks Using the CLI

## Migrate Content Between Stacks Using the CLI

This document guides you through the process of migrating content from one Contentstack stack to another manually.

## Prerequisites

-   [Contentstack account](https://www.contentstack.com/login/)
-   Contentstack CLI [installed](/docs/headless-cms/install-the-cli) and [configured](/docs/headless-cms/configure-regions-in-the-cli/)
-   CLI [authenticated](/docs/headless-cms/cli-authentication#authentication)
-   Access to both source and target stacks
-   An empty target stack

## Steps for Execution

To migrate all content from one stack to another quickly, follow the steps below:

-   [Export](/docs/headless-cms/export-content-using-the-cli) from source stack:
    
    ```
    csdx cm:stacks:export -k <source_stack_api_key> -d ./export --branch main
    ```
    
-   [Audit](/docs/headless-cms/audit-plugin) the exported content (recommended):
    
    ```
    csdx cm:stacks:audit -d ./export/main
    ```
    
    **Note:** The [audit](/docs/headless-cms/audit-plugin) process runs automatically during [import](/docs/headless-cms/import-content-using-the-cli) to validate and fix any issues.
    
-   [Import](/docs/headless-cms/import-content-using-the-cli) to target stack:
    
    ```
    csdx cm:stacks:import -k <target_stack_api_key> -d ./export/main
    ```
