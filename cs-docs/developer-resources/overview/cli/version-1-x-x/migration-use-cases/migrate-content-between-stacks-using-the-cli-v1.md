# Migrate Content Between Stacks Using the CLI | V1.x.x

## Migrate Content Between Stacks Using the CLI

This document guides you through the process of migrating content from one Contentstack stack to another manually.

## Prerequisites

-   [Contentstack account](https://www.contentstack.com/login/)
-   Contentstack CLI [installed](/docs/headless-cms/install-the-cli/v1) and [configured](/docs/headless-cms/configure-regions-in-the-cli/v1)
-   CLI [authenticated](/docs/headless-cms/cli-authentication/v1#authentication)
-   Access to both source and target stacks
-   An empty target stack

## Steps for Execution

To migrate all content from one stack to another quickly, follow the steps below:

-   [Export](/docs/headless-cms/export-content-using-the-cli/v1) from source stack:

    ```
    csdx cm:stacks:export -k <source_stack_api_key> -d ./export --branch main
    ```

-   [Audit](/docs/headless-cms/cli-audit-plugin/v1) the exported content (recommended):

    ```
    csdx cm:stacks:audit -d ./export/main
    ```

    **Note:** The [audit](/docs/headless-cms/cli-audit-plugin/v1) process runs automatically during [import](/docs/headless-cms/import-content-using-the-cli/v1) to validate and fix any issues.

-   [Import](/docs/headless-cms/import-content-using-the-cli/v1) to target stack:

    ```
    csdx cm:stacks:import -k <target_stack_api_key> -d ./export/main
    ```
