# Contentstack MCP Server

## Contentstack MCP Server

A complete guide for setting up, configuring, and using the Contentstack MCP Server with AI agents and tools.

## What is the Contentstack MCP Server?

### The Model Context Protocol

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) is an open standard that lets AI agents (Claude, Cursor, and others) connect to external systems through a common interface. Instead of writing bespoke integration code every time you want an AI to talk to an API, you run an MCP server that exposes those APIs as structured, typed tools. The agent calls those tools and interprets the results in natural language.

### What this server does

The Contentstack MCP Server bridges your Contentstack stack and related services, the Content Management API, Content Delivery API, Analytics, Automations, Launch, BrandKit, Personalize, Developer Hub, and Lytics to any MCP compatible AI agent.

Once configured, your AI agent can:

-   Read, create, update, publish, and unpublish entries and assets in plain language
-   Inspect audit logs, version history, and workflow stages
-   Trigger deployments, check logs, and revalidate CDN caches in Launch
-   Inspect and run deterministic workflows, including HTTP-triggered automation workflow
-   Generate on-brand content via BrandKit AI using voice profiles and a knowledge vault
-   Query audience segments, user profiles, and A/B test results in Personalize and Lytics
-   Manage Marketplace apps and OAuth settings in Developer Hub
-   Pull API usage, cache hit rates, and SDK adoption metrics from Analytics

### Who it's for

-   Developers building AI-powered content workflows or automations
-   Content architects who want an agent to help audit, model, or migrate content
-   DevRel and solutions engineers demonstrating Contentstack capabilities with AI
-   AI workflow builders connecting Contentstack to agent frameworks and pipelines

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

-   An active [Contentstack account](https://www.contentstack.com/login/)
-   Node.js 18 or later installed locally (required to run npx)
-   A supported MCP client:
    -   [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) (macOS / Windows)
    -   [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)
    -   [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) (CLI)
    -   Any other MCP client that supports stdio transport

## Authentication

Most API groups require OAuth authentication. Run this command once before using the server:

```
npx @contentstack/mcp --auth
```

This opens a browser window. You will:

-   Log in to your [Contentstack account](https://www.contentstack.com/login/)
-   Select your region (US, EU, AU, etc.)
-   Select your organisation
-   Grant the MCP server access

The resulting OAuth tokens are saved locally on your machine. They are reused automatically by the server on subsequent runs, you do not need to re-authenticate unless your tokens expire.

### Which groups require OAuth?

| Group | Authentication method |
| --- | --- |
| CMA, CMA Extended | OAuth or Management Token |
| Analytics | OAuth |
| Automations | OAuth |
| BrandKit | OAuth |
| Launch | OAuth |
| DeveloperHub | OAuth |
| Personalize | OAuth |
| CDA | Token-based (delivery token) |
| Lytics | Token-based (Lytics access token) |

CDA and Lytics do not use OAuth. They authenticate with static tokens you provide in environment variables.

## Authenticating without OAuth (Management Token)

If OAuth authentication is not required and you only need access to content management tooling, CMA and CMA Extended can be authenticated using a [management token](/docs/headless-cms/generate-a-management-token/). This approach is particularly well suited for headless environments and CI/CD pipelines where an interactive browser-based authentication flow is unavailable.

```
npx @contentstack/mcp --groups cma,cma-extended \
  --stack-api-key \
  --management-token \
  --region NA
```

Because there is no persisted OAuth session available to determine the target data center automatically, you must explicitly specify the region using either the \--region flag or the CONTENTSTACK\_REGION environment variable.

Management token authentication is supported only for CMA and CMA Extended. Services such as Analytics, Automations, BrandKit, Launch, DeveloperHub, and Personalize continue to require OAuth authentication. The CDA does not support OAuth or management token authentication; instead, it uses a delivery token.

| Group | OAuth | Management Token | Delivery Token |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CMA | Required | Required | Not Required |
| CMA Extended | Required | Required | Not Required |
| CDA | Not Required | Not Required | Required |
| Analytics | Required | Not Required | Not Required |
| Automations | Required | Not Required | Not Required |
| BrandKit | Required | Not Required | Not Required |
| Launch | Required | Not Required | Not Required |
| DeveloperHub | Required | Not Required | Not Required |
| Personalize | Required | Not Required | Not Required |
| Personalize | Not Required | Not Required | Lytics Token |

## Regions and Data Centers

Contentstack operates across multiple data center regions. Each service uses a region-specific base URL, and the appropriate endpoints are automatically resolved based on the region you configure.

### Supported regions

| Code | Data Center | Common Aliases |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NA | AWS North America (default) | us, aws-na, aws\_na |
| EU | AWS Europe | aws-eu, aws\_eu |
| AU | AWS Australia | aws-au, aws\_au |
| AZURE\_NA | Azure North America | azure-na |
| AZURE\_EU | Azure Europe | azure-eu |
| GCP\_NA | GCP North America | gcp-na |
| GCP\_EU | GCP Europe | gcp-eu |

Region aliases are case-insensitive and separator-insensitive. For example, EU, eu, aws-eu, and AWS\_EU all resolve to the same EU region.

### How the region is chosen

Region resolution follows this order of precedence:

1.  **Explicit configuration**: A region specified using the \--region flag or the CONTENTSTACK\_REGION environment variable always takes precedence. If the provided value is not recognized, the application returns an error.
2.  **OAuth session:** When you authenticate using npx @contentstack/mcp --auth, the selected data center is stored with the OAuth session and is used automatically when no explicit region is configured.
3.  **Default region:** If neither an explicit region nor a saved OAuth session is available, the region defaults to NA.

When using a delivery-token-only (CDA) or management-token-only (CMA) configuration, no OAuth session is available to determine the target region automatically. In these scenarios, you must explicitly set the region using the CONTENTSTACK\_REGION environment variable or the \--region flag to ensure requests are routed to the correct data center.

Regional endpoint mappings are sourced from Contentstack’s official region registry, ensuring that the server remains automatically synchronized with newly added and updated data centers. The registry is available at https://artifacts.contentstack.com/regions.json.

## Installation

No installation or repository cloning is needed. The server runs on demand via npx:

```
npx @contentstack/mcp
```

The -y flag (used in MCP client configs) automatically confirms the npx prompt, so the agent can start the server without human input:

```
npx -y @contentstack/mcp
```

npx pulls the latest published version of @contentstack/mcp from npm each time it runs. This means you always get the latest tool definitions without a manual upgrade step.

## Configuration

The server is configured through environment variables or equivalent CLI arguments. Both work identically, use whichever your MCP client supports.

### Environment variables

| Variable | CLI argument | Description | Required for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CONTENTSTACK\_API\_KEY | --stack-api-key | Your Contentstack Stack API Key | CMA, CMA Extended, CDA, DeveloperHub |
| CONTENTSTACK\_DELIVERY\_TOKEN | --delivery-token | Delivery token for the target environment | CDA only |
| CONTENTSTACK\_MANAGEMENT\_TOKEN | --management-token | Management token: an alternative to OAuth for CMA / CMA Extended | CMA / CMA Extended without OAuth |
| CONTENTSTACK\_REGION | --region | center to target (see \[Regions\](#regions-and-data-centers)) | Data | Optional — defaults to NA |
| CONTENTSTACK\_BRAND\_KIT\_ID | --brand-kit-id | Your Brand Kit ID | BrandKit only |
| CONTENTSTACK\_LAUNCH\_PROJECT\_ID | --launch-project-id | Your Launch Project UID | Launch only |
| CONTENTSTACK\_ORGANIZATION\_UID | --organization-uid | Your Organisation UID | Launch only |
| CONTENTSTACK\_PERSONALIZE\_PROJECT\_ID | --personalize-project-id | Your Personalize Project ID | Personalize only |
| LYTICS\_ACCESS\_TOKEN | --lytics-access-token | Your Lytics access token | Lytics only |
| GROUPS | --groups | Comma-separated list of API groups to enable | Optional - defaults to cma |
| CONTENTSTACK\_ENVIRONMENT | - | Default environment name used by enrichment | Optional |
| CONTENTSTACK\_BRANCH | - | Default locale code used by enrichment | Optional |
| CONTENTSTACK\_LOCALE | - | Default branch used by enrichment (defaults to main) | Optional |
| CONTENTSTACK\_MCP\_ENRICH\_TOOL | - | Set to false to disable stack-aware tool enrichment | Optional (on by default) |

You only need to configure the environment variables required for the services you're actually using. If you're working solely with CMA, all you need is CONTENTSTACK\_API\_KEY along with a valid authentication method, either an OAuth session or a CONTENTSTACK\_MANAGEMENT\_TOKEN. If you also enable CDA, make sure to additionally provide a CONTENTSTACK\_DELIVERY\_TOKEN.

### Stack-aware tool enrichment

Starting in version 0.9.0, each tools/list response can enrich supported tool descriptions and input schemas with live metadata, helping agents select valid values instead of guessing. This feature is enabled by default; to disable it, set CONTENTSTACK\_MCP\_ENRICH\_TOOLS=false.

-   CDA tools bootstrap from the delivery token via GET /v3/content\_types, along with the configured environment, branch, and locale.
-   CMA and CMA Extended tools bootstrap from a management token or OAuth session, fetching content types, environments, locales, and branches in parallel.
-   Launch tools bootstrap from OAuth via the Launch manage REST API (GET /projects/{project\_uid}/environments); GraphQL tool mappers remain unchanged.
-   Brand Kit tools bootstrap from OAuth via two REST hosts: voice profiles from the brand-kits-api, and Knowledge Vault from the AI host.
-   Personalize tools bootstrap from OAuth via the Personalize management API, covering attributes, audiences, experiences, and events.
-   Developer Hub tools bootstrap from OAuth via the Marketplace apps REST API (GET /apps); the organization UID comes from OAuth or CONTENTSTACK\_ORGANIZATION\_UID, and the stack API key comes from CONTENTSTACK\_API\_KEY.
-   Each tool's JSON declares an "x-enrich-group" value, cda, cma, launch, brandkit, personalize, or developerhub, with CMA Extended tools using the cma enrichment profile. Rules are defined in [tools/enrich-profiles.json](https://mcp.contentstack.com/enrich-profiles/tools).

Stack context is cached for five minutes per connection. CMA enrichment is skipped when only a delivery token is available (for example, CDA-only credentials with CMA groups loaded).

See [Build your own MCP Stack-aware enrichment](https://developers.contentstack.com/guides/how-to-build-your-own-mcp-server-with-contentstack-s-tools-api) for the full extension spec.

### Where to find your credentials

-   **Stack API Key:** Contentstack Dashboard → Settings → API Credentials
-   **Delivery Token:** Contentstack Dashboard → Settings → Tokens → Delivery Tokens → create one for your target environment
-   **Management Token:** Contentstack Dashboard → Settings → Tokens → Management Tokens → create one (only if authenticating CMA without OAuth)
-   **Brand Kit ID:** BrandKit Dashboard → your brand kit's settings page
-   **Launch Project ID:** Launch Dashboard → your project's URL or settings
-   Organisation UID: Launch Dashboard → your project's URL or organisation settings
-   **Personalize Project ID:** Personalize Dashboard → your project's settings
-   **Lytics Access Token:** [Lytics account settings](https://docs.lytics.com/docs/access-tokens) → API Tokens

### Custom endpoints (dedicated infrastructure)

Customers on dedicated or private infrastructure whose hosts differ from the standard regional endpoints can override individual service base URLs. When set, an override fully replaces the region-derived base URL for that service, including any path suffix the service expects (for example, Launch's /manage). A trailing slash is trimmed automatically, and any service without an override falls back to the regional default.

| Envrionment Variable | Service |
| --- | --- |
| CONTENTSTACK\_CMA\_BASE\_URL | CMA and CMA Extended |
| CONTENTSTACK\_CDA\_BASE\_URL | CDA |
| CONTENTSTACK\_DEVELOPERHUB\_BASE\_URL | Developer Hub |
| CONTENTSTACK\_PERSONALIZE\_BASE\_URL | Personalize |
| CONTENTSTACK\_ANALYTICS\_BASE\_URL | Analytics |
| CONTENTSTACK\_AUTOMATIONS\_BASE\_URL | Automations |
| CONTENTSTACK\_LAUNCH\_BASE\_URL | Launch (include /manage) |
| CONTENTSTACK\_BRANDKIT\_AI\_BASE\_URL | BrandKit: AI host |
| CONTENTSTACK\_BRANDKIT\_API\_BASE\_URL | BrandKit: brand-kits-api host |
| CONTENTSTACK\_LYTICS\_BASE\_URL | Lytics |

```
CONTENTSTACK_CMA_BASE_URL=https://acme-cma.internal.example.com
CONTENTSTACK_CDA_BASE_URL=https://acme-cdn.internal.example.com
```

### The GROUPS variable

The GROUPS variable controls which API toolsets are exposed to the agent. Loading only what you need is good practice, it reduces the volume of tool definitions sent to the model on every turn, keeping context windows lean and responses focused.

| Group value | Tools | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cma | 78 | Core content management: entries, assets, content types, branches, releases, publishing, variants, environments, global fields, taxonomies |
| cma-extended | 22 | Audit logs, version history, global field writes, asset folder management, workflow and publish rule inspection — load alongside cma |
| cda | 4 | Published content via CDN: fast, read-only delivery of entries and assets |
| analytics | 8 | API/CDN usage, cache performance, status codes, SDK adoption, device/URL analytics |
| automations | 9 | Agent OS projects, automation inspection, activation controls, and HTTP-triggered workflow executions |
| brandkit | 12 | AI content generation, voice profiles, knowledge vault |
| launch | 27 | Projects, environments, deployments, deploy hooks, logs, file upload, CDN cache revalidation |
| developerhub | 12 | Marketplace app lifecycle, OAuth settings, app installations |
| lytics | 10 | Audiences, user profiles, content topics, classification, fields, tables |
| personalize | 24 | Attributes, audiences, experiences, events, analytics, geolocation helpers |
| all | all of the above | Enable everything - best for exploration and prototyping |

Examples:

bashCopy

```
GROUPS=cma
GROUPS=cma,cma-extended
GROUPS=cma,cda
GROUPS=all
```

**Tip:** For everyday content operations, cma alone is sufficient. Add cma-extended only when the session requires audit trails, version inspection, or workflow context. Loading all is convenient for exploration but sends the full tool list to the model on every turn.

## MCP Client Setup

### Claude Desktop

Edit ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude\_desktop\_config.json on macOS, or %APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude\_desktop\_config.json on Windows.

#### Option A: Environment variables (recommended):

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "contentstack": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@contentstack/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "CONTENTSTACK_API_KEY": "<YOUR_STACK_API_KEY>",
        "CONTENTSTACK_DELIVERY_TOKEN": "<YOUR_DELIVERY_TOKEN>",
        "CONTENTSTACK_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN": "<YOUR_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN>"
        "CONTENTSTACK_BRAND_KIT_ID": "<YOUR_BRAND_KIT_ID>",
        "CONTENTSTACK_LAUNCH_PROJECT_ID": "<YOUR_LAUNCH_PROJECT_ID>",
        "CONTENTSTACK_ORGANIZATION_UID": "<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_UID>"
        "CONTENTSTACK_PERSONALIZE_PROJECT_ID": "<YOUR_PERSONALIZE_PROJECT_ID>",
        "LYTICS_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_LYTICS_TOKEN>",
        "GROUPS": "cma"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Only include the env vars relevant to the groups you are enabling. Remove keys you do not need.

#### Option B: CLI arguments (use if your client does not support env vars):

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "contentstack": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@contentstack/mcp",
        "--stack-api-key",
        "<YOUR_STACK_API_KEY>",
        "--delivery-token",
        "<YOUR_DELIVERY_TOKEN>",
        "--brand-kit-id",
        "<YOUR_BRAND_KIT_ID>",
        "--launch-project-id",
        "<YOUR_LAUNCH_PROJECT_ID>",
        "--organization-uid",
        "<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_UID>",
        "--lytics-access-token",
        "<YOUR_LYTICS_TOKEN>",
        "--personalize-project-id",
        "<YOUR_PERSONALIZE_PROJECT_ID>",
        "--groups",
        "cma"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

After editing the file, restart Claude Desktop to pick up the changes.

### Cursor

Edit ~/.cursor/mcp.json (create it if it does not exist):

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "contentstack": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@contentstack/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "CONTENTSTACK_API_KEY": "<YOUR_STACK_API_KEY>",
        "GROUPS": "cma"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Cursor after saving.

### Claude Code (CLI)

Use the claude mcp add command to register the server:

```
claude mcp add contentstack \
  --command "npx" \
  --args "-y,@contentstack/mcp" \
  --env "CONTENTSTACK_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>,GROUPS=cma"
```

### Other MCP clients

The Contentstack MCP Server uses **stdio transport**, which is the standard for locally-run MCP servers. Any MCP client that supports stdio should work with the same configuration pattern: point the client at npx -y @contentstack/mcp and pass your credentials via environment variables or CLI arguments.

## API Groups: what to load and when

### CMA: Content Management API

Authorization: OAuth or Management Token

**Load with:** GROUPS=cma

**Requires:** Stack API Key

The core group for content operations. Covers the full lifecycle of entries and assets: create, read, update, delete, publish, unpublish, and localize. Also includes branches, branch aliases, merge jobs, releases, publishing queues, content types, global fields, taxonomies, terms, variants, and environments.

Use this group for:

-   Day-to-day content management tasks
-   Content modelling and schema inspection
-   Bulk publishing or unpublishing workflows
-   Branch management and merge operations

78 tools. See the [Tool Catalog](/docs/developers/contentstack-mcp-server#content-management-api-cma) for the full list.

### CMA Extended - Content Management API Extended

Authorization: OAuth or Management Token

**Load with:** GROUPS=cma,cma-extended

**Requires:** Stack API Key

Extends CMA with administrative and investigative capabilities. Load alongside cma when the session requires:

-   **Audit logs:** every create, update, delete, publish, and unpublish action is recorded.
-   **Version history:** inspect or label every version of an entry or asset.
-   **Global field writes:** create, update, and delete global fields.
-   **Asset folder management:** create, rename, and delete asset folders.
-   **Workflow inspection:** retrieve workflow definitions and publish rules.

22 tools. See the [Tool Catalog](/docs/developers/contentstack-mcp-server#content-management-api-extended-cma-extended) for the full list.

### CDA: Content Delivery API

Authentication: Token-based

**Load with:** GROUPS=cda

**Requires:** Stack API Key + Delivery Token

Delivers published content through Contentstack's global CDN. Read-only. Returns only content that has been published to the target environment — draft or unpublished entries are not visible.

Does not require OAuth. Authenticate by providing a delivery token scoped to your target environment.

4 tools. See the [Tool Catalog](/docs/developers/contentstack-mcp-server#content-delivery-api-cda) for the full list.

### Analytics

Authentication: OAuth

**Load with:** GROUPS=analytics

**Requires:** No additional tokens

Usage analytics for your Contentstack organisation: API call volumes, CDN bandwidth, cache hit/miss ratios, HTTP status code distribution, SDK version adoption, and URL-level traffic patterns.

All analytics tools are asynchronous — they return a jobId which you then pass to get\_job\_data to retrieve the results once the job completes.

8 tools. See the [Tool Catalog](/docs/developers/contentstack-mcp-server#analytics-api) for the full list.

### Automations

**Load with:** GROUPS=automations

**Authentication**OAuth

**Requires:** No additional tokens

Agent OS management and deterministic workflow execution. Manage Agent OS projects, inspect automation rules, activate or deactivate configured automations, and run workflows that use an HTTP Request trigger.

Use \`list\_automations\` or \`get\_automation\` with \`show\_steps: true\` to identify HTTP-triggered workflows. Those automations expose a trigger \`id\`; pass that value to \`trigger\_automation\` with an optional JSON payload to run the workflow through MCP. This lets an agent choose when to run a workflow while Automation Hub controls exactly how the work is performed.

See the [Tool Catalog](/docs/developers/contentstack-mcp-server#automations-api) for the full list.

### BrandKit

Authentication: OAuth

**Load with:** GROUPS=brandkit

**Requires:** Brand Kit ID

-   **Voice Profiles:** define the tone, style, formality, and complexity of generated content.
-   **Knowledge Vault:** a store of brand guidelines, reference materials, and tone-of-voice examples.
-   **Generative AI:** combines your voice profile and knowledge vault context to produce on-brand content.

12 tools. See the [Tool Catalog](/docs/developers/contentstack-mcp-server#brandkit-ai) for the full list.

### Launch

Authentication: OAuth

**Load with:** GROUPS=launch

**Requires:** Launch Project ID + Organisation UID

**27 tools**

Full control over Launch, Contentstack's hosting and deployment platform. Manage projects and environments, create and trigger deploy hooks, monitor deployment status and build logs, fetch server runtime logs, upload ZIP files for file-based deployments, and revalidate CDN caches after content updates.

Supports both Git-connected projects (GitHub, Bitbucket) and file-upload projects.

See the [Tool Catalog](/docs/developers/contentstack-mcp-server#launch-api) for the full list.

### Developer Hub

Authentication: OAuth

**Load with:** GROUPS=developerhub

**Requires:** Stack API Key

**12 tools**

Manage Contentstack Marketplace apps. Create, update, and delete apps, configure OAuth settings, install apps into stacks or organisations, and inspect existing installations.

Use this group when building or managing custom integrations, UI extensions, webhooks, or automation apps on the Contentstack Marketplace.

When enrichment is enabled, tool descriptions display your organization's Marketplace apps, and app\_uid parameters are populated with enums from GET/apps.

See the [Tool Catalog](/docs/developers/contentstack-mcp-server#developer-hub) for the full list.

### Lytics

Token-based

**Load with:** GROUPS=lytics

**Requires:** Lytics Access Token

Access your Lytics customer data platform. Retrieve audience segments, look up individual user profiles, explore content topics and classifications, inspect schema fields and data tables, and classify or enrich content via Lytics' AI engine.

## Common Workflows

Once configured, you interact with Contentstack entirely through natural language. Here are examples of what agents can do with different groups enabled.

**Content management (****CMA****):**

-   "Get all entries for the article content type that were published in the last 30 days"
-   "Create a new entry in blog\_post with the title 'Getting started with MCP' and publish it to the production environment"
-   "Show me all entries that reference the asset with UID blt1234abcd"
-   "Create a branch called feature/new-homepage from main and add the hero entry to a release"
-   "What environments does this stack have, and which locales are configured?"

**Auditing and investigation (****CMA, CMA-extended****):**

-   "Show me the audit log for the last 24 hours - who changed what?"
-   "What versions exist for entry blt9abc in the product content type? Label version 4 as 'Pre-launch approved'"
-   "Which workflow stages require approval before an entry can be published?"

**Content delivery (****CDA****):**

-   "Fetch the latest published entries from the homepage\_banner content type on the production environment"
-   "What does the live version of entry blt5678efgh look like right now?"

**Deployments (****Launch****):**

-   "What's the current deployment status of the staging environment?"
-   "Fetch the build logs from the last deployment — did it fail anywhere?"
-   "Trigger the deploy hook for the production environment"
-   "Revalidate the CDN cache after I update the hero entry"

**Brand content (****Brandkit****):**

-   "Generate a product description for a new running shoe using the 'Active lifestyle' voice profile"
-   "Add the updated brand guidelines document to the Knowledge Vault"
-   "What voice profiles are available in my Brand Kit?"

**Personalization (****Personalize****):**

-   "Show me all active A/B test experiences and their current conversion rates"
-   "Create a new audience segment for users in Germany who have viewed more than 3 product pages"
-   "What's the analytics summary for experience version ver\_abc123 over the last 7 days?"

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "Unauthorized" errors on CMA / Analytics / Launch calls | OAuth not run, or tokens expired | Run npx @contentstack/mcp --auth and complete the flow |
| CDA returns empty or 401 errors | Missing or incorrect delivery token | Check CONTENTSTACK\_DELIVERY\_TOKEN — it must be scoped to the correct environment |
| Contentstack tools not appearing in your MCP client | GROUPS value is wrong or malformed | Check for typos and spaces — use comma-separated values with no spaces, e.g. cma,cda |
| Launch tools fail with auth errors | Organisation UID not set | Add CONTENTSTACK\_ORGANIZATION\_UID to your environment — find it in the Launch dashboard URL |
| Lytics tools return 403 | Expired or incorrect access token | Regenerate your Lytics access token and update LYTICS\_ACCESS\_TOKEN |
| Analytics get\_job\_data returns "200 Job active" | Job still processing | Wait a few seconds and retry — analytics jobs are asynchronous |
| npx prompts for confirmation in the client | -y flag missing | Ensure your args array includes "-y" as the first argument after "npx" |
| Requests hit the wrong data center, or return 404 / 401 | Region not set (no OAuth to infer it) | Set CONTENTSTACK\_REGION / --region to match your stack's data center |
| Unknown region "…" error on startup | Misspelled region value | Use a supported code or alias, see \[Regions\](#regions-and-data-centers) |
| CMA calls fail with auth errors and no OAuth session | No management token provided | Run --auth, or set CONTENTSTACK\_MANAGEMENT\_TOKEN and CONTENTSTACK\_REGION |
