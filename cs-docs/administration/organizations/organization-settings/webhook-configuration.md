# Webhook Configuration

## Webhook Configuration

Webhook Configuration lets you set the maximum connections per second for all webhooks in your organization. This limit determines the maximum connections permitted to webhook URLs at any given time. Once the limit is reached, connections are efficiently throttled to avoid surpassing it.

By configuring [webhooks](/docs/headless-cms/about-webhooks), you can designate a specific URL for Contentstack to send data to whenever a relevant event occurs in your stack.

## Prerequisites

-   [Contentstack account](https://www.contentstack.com/login/)
-   Organization [Owner or Admin](/docs/administration/about-administration-roles) permissions

## What You Will Learn

-   How to set the connection rate limit for your organization's webhooks.

-   How throttling applies once the connection limit is reached.


## Set Connection limit

To set the connection limit for the webhooks in your organization, log in to your [Contentstack account](https://www.contentstack.com/login) and follow the steps below:

1.  Click the "Profile" icon in the top-right corner, then select your org from **Switch Organization**.
2.  Navigate to **Administration** from "App Switcher".
3.  Click the **Webhook Configuration** tab from the header.
4.  Enter the limit (between 2 and 100) in the **Connection Rate Limit** field.
5.  Click **Save** to save your configuration![Connection Rate Limit field in Webhook Configuration](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt2d43f51baca745a8/bltc643f9c3f9b1b466/6628b0eb528fc1a2c755b3d3/Webhook_Configuration_in_Org_Admin.png)

**Note:** Due to the distributed nature of systems, the actual message rate may occasionally exceed the enforced rate limit. For instance, if a rate limit of 50 per second is set, an endpoint might receive messages at a rate of 53 or higher.
